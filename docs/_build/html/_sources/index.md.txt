# fasttomo

Introducing **`fasttomo`**, a specialized Python package crafted for the essential task of detecting copper agglomerates in lithium-ion batteries during thermal runaway events. This package, a product of my Master's thesis at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) between October 2023 and March 2024, provides a suite of analytical and visualization tools for handling 4-dimensional CT data.
