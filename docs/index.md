# fasttomo

Welcome to **`fasttomo`**, a Python package designed to address the critical task of identifying copper agglomerates in lithium-ion batteries during thermal runaway. Developed as part of my Master's thesis at ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) from October 2023 to March 2024, `fasttomo` offers a powerful set of tools for analyzing and visualizing 4-dimensional CT data in `(t, z, y, x)` format.
